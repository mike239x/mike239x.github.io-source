# mike239x.github.io-source
source files for my own website (hugo based)

Source files to be used with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to create files for my own website.

To produce the static pages run `hugo` - resulting pages would be in `public` folder.
You can also `hugo server -D` to host a local server (for dev purposes), `-D` flag is to serve drafts as well.

Things to do:

- port over here current mike239x.github.io
- port over here texts from dev.to and whatever else (mb taaasty via wayback machine?)
- Add CI via github actions and github pages - see [this](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)
- read though [hugo front matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/)
- find out how to inject html/javascript into markdown pages
- find out how to have some kind of table of contents on the main page (not just a list of posts)
- improve the front page look overall
- add About and Contant pages? (with menu buttons on top)
- figure out how to set cover image for posts maybe? (relevant only for mizjam 1)
