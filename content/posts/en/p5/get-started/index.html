Compared to the usual way p5.js sketches are done, to properly integrate one on a website one has to do some more work.
While normally the js code for the sketch would look like this:

{{< highlight js >}}
function setup() {
  let canvas = createCanvas(600, 400);
  background(220);
  fill(255);
}
function draw() {
  if (mouseIsPressed) {
    ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 80, 80);
  }
}
{{< / highlight >}}

This works, but positions the canvas at the bottom of the document body, in a way that it looks ugly unless there is
nothing else on the page. Instead one has to use an <a
    href="https://p5js.org/examples/instance-mode-instance-container.html">instance container</a> - create an empty div
with some ID and in the javascript code target that div to use for sketching. This however makes the code slightly less
convinient:

{{< highlight js >}}
let sketch = (p) => {
  p.setup = () => {
    let canvas = p.createCanvas(600, 400);
    p.background(220);
    p.fill(255);
  }
  p.draw = () => {
    if (p.mouseIsPressed) {
      p.ellipse(p.mouseX, p.mouseY, 80, 80);
    }
  }
};
new p5(sketch, 'container');
{{< / highlight >}}

Btw, here is how it looks like:
<div id='container'></div>
<script src="/p5.min.js"></script>
<script src=sketch.js></script>
